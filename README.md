# HTMX POC

A Prove Of Concept for `HTMX`. I built this TODO APP to figure out the meme of HTMX.

HTMX has lovers and haters (serious haters) but, personally, i like it (as a full backend developer with poor JS skills).

HTMX is great for basic web apps like this, i guess.

## Built With

- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
